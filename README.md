# MyPrjcts
print("Hello Git_World :-) ")

Hi Guys my app is a multithreaded chat server with a GUI chat client.It however blocks on the recv call for networked environments.Possible solutions I am working on include creating a protocol on top of the sockets to detect end of file since it hangs on the recv call in the client.Feel free to contribute or email me your suggestions.
